# Diet-Zen - Diet Plan Maker üçä

This is a part of our SEM 4 Mini Project for Second Year Engineering and is purely team work!

## Problem Statement:

Having a proper nutrients in a day is not just a choice but also a necessity of the body. A diet lacking essential vitamins, minerals and other nutrients can cause malnutrition, fatigue and a host of physical and psychological ailments. It is seen in common that people are not focusing on their diet, especially youngsters are so addicted to junk food which causes them many physical and mental problems at a very young age. Nowadays people are so busy and lazy that they don‚Äôt even have time to make a proper diet plan for their body.

In-order to overcome above problems we require a diet planner which can create a healthy diet for us according to the needs of one‚Äôs body. This can make one healthy and prevent from eating unhealthy food.
